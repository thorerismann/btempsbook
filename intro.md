This project analyzes the urban heat island effect in Biel/Bienne from July 2022 - September 2022 with a five temperature sensors placed within the city and two serving as reference measurements. This project will inform the placement of the full sensor network of ~40 sites in 2023.

The urban heat island effect is the difference between built-up areas and surrounding rural reference points. Biel/Bienne has a unique topography to explore the effects of urban heat thanks to the neighboring Jura mountain range, the Lake of Biel and the river Suze which cuts through the city.

*First results available for the historic July heatwaves*
