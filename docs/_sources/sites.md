# An overview of the sensor sites

Seven sensors were placed in strategic locations for this pilot project. Five locations are in the city of Biel/Bienne (log_1 - log_5) and two reference locations were set up as well. The first is a rural reference (log_6) located between Biel and Orpund and the second (log_7) is referenced to the SwissMeteo Automatic Weather Station network in Grenchen airport. All sensors were placed at three meter heights above the ground.

Additional photos available upon request. Photos taken by Dr. Moritz Gruber and Gabrial Erismann the day of installation on July 08th 2022.

There will be between 25 and 40 sensors available for the main project in 2023. The pilot locations will be maintained for both seasons in order to generate a first set of interseasonal data.
