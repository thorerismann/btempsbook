# First results

From July 08th 2022 to September 25th 2022, 7 sensors were placed in urban and rual locations around Biel/Bienne to capture air temperature measurements and plan for a larger surveillance network for summer 2023.

The first data collection occured from 11.08.2022 - 14.08.2022. The raw data set is available through the sister github repository.

The below plots of raw data grouped according to sensor location suggest the following:
1) All sensors functioning properly, with no obvious outliers and no missing data.
2) Rural minimum temperatures are consistently below urban ones, converge with urban temperatures on maximum values
3) The rural references correspond well to each other
4) The Park Muncipal / Stadtpark sensor (Log_4) registered the highest temperatures likely due to a lack of ventilation
