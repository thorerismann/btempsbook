# Local Climate Zones of Biel/Bienne

## What is a Local Climate Zone
The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification is a decade-old classification system for urban landscapes and has become an international standard. The image below from {cite}`Demuzere2021` provides information on the 16 different zones under the classification.

## Preliminary Local Climate Zone maps

The LCZ generator tool published in the Demezure et. al 2021 [https://lcz-generator.rub.de/](https://lcz-generator.rub.de/) was used to produce maps of the local climate zone in Biel. Areas were drawn out  New training maps will be generated following the resolution of the classification problems noted above.

Results of the first and second training runs of the local climate zone generator for the city of Biel/Bienne. Notice the more detailed classifications in the second run as more spaces were included in the training file. 

Looking at the overlay of the sensors on this map we can see that we will / we will not capture the following hot zones / cool zones:
