# Assessing summer air temperatures in Biel/Bienne Switzerland 2022-2023. 

:::{note}
 *First results available for the historic July heatwaves*
:::

This project analyzes the summer air temperature in Biel/Bienne from July 2022 - September 2022 and from May 2023 - September 2023. The first phase of the project uses five temperature sensors placed within the city and two serving as reference measurements. This project will inform the placement of the full sensor network of around 30 sites in phase 2 in 2023. It builds off of the 4-year running air temperature measurement network created by the Geography Institute of the University of Bern. Not only have the sensors and data methods been tested and published in peer reviewed papers, but the relative proximity of Biel to Bern (~ 25 km) ensures the data and methods provide a useful reference point.

Increased public awareness of the threat that heatwaves can pose to vulnerable people, along with the projected increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves, has led to an increased interest in the urban heat island effect. This is defined as difference in air temperature between built-up areas and surrounding rural reference points due to the different features of the city. Biel/Bienne has a unique topography to explore the effects of urban heat especially thanks to the neighboring Jura mountain range, the Lake of Biel, the Thielle river, the Suze river, and the Nidau-BÃ¼ren Kanal which border and (and in the case of the Suze) cut through the city.
